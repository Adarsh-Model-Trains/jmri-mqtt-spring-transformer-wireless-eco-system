# Arduino Uno/mega client for Snapeswitch and led signals 

---

> arduino client will connect to the esp via seraila Rx/Tx pins 
> gnd will be common in both the devices 


### Configuration of the number of boards based on the turnout light and 2 and 3 led signals 
> msut match in node configuraiton in transformer 
```
#define NO_OF_TURNOUT_BOARDS 3
#define NO_OF_LIGHT_BOARDS 3
#define NO_OF_TOTAL_BOARDS 6
```

## To Open Two arduino sperate ide on mac 
* $ open -n -a Arduino
* -n = open new instance even when one is already running
* -a xxx = open application xxx

### Connection details 
```
conect the gnd from arduino to the -ve line of the breadboard 
take nodemcu/esp8266 connect the gnd/-ve from breadboard to the gnd of the nodemcu/esp8266
take the tx pin of the nodemcu/esp8266 and connect to the rx pin of the arduino 
take the rx pin of the nodemcu/esp8266 and connect to the tx pin of the arduino 

```
